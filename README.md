Flood Frequency Analysis: A Study on the Wye River
Combining R and Excel
Welcome to the repository for our hydrological data analysis. This README provides an overview of the workflow and how R code and Excel datasets have been seamlessly integrated.

# Overview

This project aims to analyze hydrological data from various stations. We utilize the statistical prowess of R alongside the organizational and visual capabilities of Excel. Together, they form a potent combination, ensuring a rigorous yet easily interpretable analysis.

# Usage
Ensure that both R and the necessary libraries are installed.
Download the entire repository to retain the directory structure.
Open the R scripts in the scripts/ directory. Make sure to adjust any path-specific commands if you choose to change the directory structure.
Run the scripts. They're designed to fetch data from the Excel sheets, process them, and generate relevant outputs.
